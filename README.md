## **Simple web game using web.py**

**Before you run bin/app.py you need to change your PYTHONPATH environment variable.**

* In your Terminal, type:
             export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:.
* On Windows PowerShell, type:
             $env:PYTHONPATH = "$env:PYTHONPATH;."
            
**You should only have to do it once per shell session**
